# jev-model-router

Picks the model and the reasoning effort each task runs with, using [Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev), TypeSafe's System One decision model: unstructured state in, a typed choice with a probability distribution out, no free-form text.

Two backends, chosen by whichever key is set:

| Backend | Endpoint | Model | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typesafe` | `POST api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` | `jev-latest` | reported per answer |
| `gateway` | `POST ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model` | `typesafe-ai/jev` | derived from an optional distribution |

TypeSafe's own API wins when both keys are set: it is the only one that reports a calibrated confidence, which is what the confidence bars below read. Set `provider` to force one, or to `builtin` to use neither. Each backend keeps its own URL and model option, so an override written for one is never sent to the other. A `provider` forced onto a backend whose key is missing degrades to the built-in classifier and says so once in the log.

Three switches, and they are not equally safe:

| Switch | What it sets | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `routeSubagentModel` | the model of each subagent, at `agent.spawn` | on |
| `routeMainEffort` | the reasoning effort of the main conversation, at `turn.step` | on |
| `routeMainModel` | the model of the main conversation, at `turn.step` | **off** |

A subagent starts with its own context, so routing its model costs nothing beyond the classification. Changing the main loop's *model* mid-session is the expensive one: it invalidates the prompt cache, and on a long context re-caching can cost more than the cheaper tier saves. Turn it on once you have measured your own sessions, not before.

The Agent tool has no effort parameter, so a subagent's effort is not this mod's to set.

**Both directions, both dimensions.** A task read as mechanical is routed down; one read as hard is routed up — model and effort alike.

The prompt is classified at `prompt.submit`, which runs before the turn starts, and the decision is applied to the turn's first model request and reused by the rest of that turn.

**With no key configured the mod still works**: it falls back to the engine's own `$.model.classify`, which answers the same question with the small fast model. That path reports no confidence, so the threshold does not apply to it.

## What it asks

One request, three questions evaluated in parallel:

- `tier` — a `choice` between three descriptions of the *work* (mechanical and local / ordinary engineering / hard or high-stakes). The decision model never sees a model name.
- `effort` — a `score` on a four-level rubric, for how much step-by-step reasoning the task needs.
- `risky` — whether the task touches production, money, credentials, or state that cannot be undone. A `noul` on TypeSafe's API, a `boolean` on the Gateway: the same question under two names.

## How it decides

TypeSafe's API reports a `confidence` per answer. The Gateway's answer shape carries **no `confidence` field**, so on that backend confidence is read as the highest probability in the distribution — and that distribution is itself optional in the schema, in which case confidence is absent and the threshold does not fire.

The two mistakes do not cost the same, so they do not clear the same bar:

- Spending **more** (a bigger model, more reasoning) needs `minUpgradeConfidence`, 0.3 by default. Being wrong costs money.
- Spending **less** needs `minDowngradeConfidence`, 0.6 by default. Being wrong means a task handled by too small a model or too little thought.
- `risky` above 0.7 takes the deep tier and real reasoning, past both bars. That one is not a confidence question.
- A backend that reports no confidence at all — the Gateway without a distribution, or the built-in classifier — may only move a request **up**. Spending less on an unmeasured hunch is the bad trade.
- A model id matching no tier, or a numeric effort (the caller's own scale), has no knowable direction: the model gets the gentler upgrade bar, and a numeric effort is left alone.

Every other failure — a non-2xx response, a timeout, a malformed body, a thrown error — leaves the request exactly as the engine built it. The router never blocks a turn.

## Privacy

With a key set, the prompt text leaves the machine and goes to whichever backend the key belongs to. The main-loop path sends the prompt; the subagent path sends the subagent's prompt, its description and its agent type. Nothing else. With no key set, nothing leaves the machine.

## Options

```

  gatewayApiKey:          string  Vercel AI Gateway key
  provider:               string  "auto" | "typesafe" | "gateway" | "builtin"
  typesafeBaseUrl:        string  empty uses https://api.typesafe.ai
  typesafeModel:          string  empty uses jev-latest
  gatewayBaseUrl:         string  empty uses https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai
  gatewayModel:           string  empty uses typesafe-ai/jev
  fastModel:              string  fast tier (default "haiku")

Declared in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`userConfig`). Set them in `/config`, in user settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`, not project settings), with `--settings <file>` or in managed settings:

```json
{ "pluginConfigs": { "jev-model-router": { "options": { "typesafeApiKey": "" } } } }
```

## Install

```sh
npx claude-code-templates@latest --mod productivity/jev-model-router
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude
```

It is written to `.claude/skills/jev-model-router/`, which Claude Code auto-loads as `jev-model-router@skills-dir`. For one session with hot reload: `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude --plugin-dir .claude/skills/jev-model-router`. `claude plugin validate .claude/skills/jev-model-router` prints every event it hooks and every `$` call it makes.

## Tests

```sh
bun test cli-tool/components/mods/productivity/jev-model-router/tests
```

**Early access.** Mods need Claude Code 2.1.259+ with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1`; the `$` API may change between releases. Typed against Anthropic's declarations: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/mods

A mod runs without `node_modules`, so neither `@typesafe-ai/sdk` nor the AI SDK is available here: both backends are spoken to over HTTP through `$.http.fetch`. The TypeSafe wire shape was read from `@typesafe-ai/sdk` v0.6.0; the Gateway's, which is `experimental` in the AI SDK (`experimental_evaluate`, 7.0.105+) and not documented publicly, from `@ai-sdk/gateway` v4.0.86 and `@ai-sdk/provider` v4.0.17. Either may change.
