 *             `{ model, state, questions }`; a yes/no question is a `noul`

 *   gateway   POST https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model
 *             `{ state, questions }` with the model in a header; a yes/no
 *             question is a `boolean`, and there is no `confidence` field —
 *             it has to be derived from an optional distribution.
 *
 * The Gateway shape is not documented publicly; it was read from
