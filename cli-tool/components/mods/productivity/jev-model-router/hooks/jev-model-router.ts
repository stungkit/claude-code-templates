/**
 * jev-model-router — Claude Mod (EARLY ACCESS)
 *
 * Picks the model each task runs on with TypeSafe's Jev, a System One
 * decision model: unstructured state in, a typed choice with a probability
 * distribution out.
 *
 * Jev is reached one of two ways, whichever key is configured: TypeSafe's
 * own API (`typesafeApiKey`), which reports a calibrated confidence per
 * answer, or the Vercel AI Gateway (`gatewayApiKey`), which does not. With
 * neither, the engine's own `$.model.classify` stands in, so the mod is
 * useful without any account.
 *
 * Three things it can set, each on its own switch:
 *   agent.spawn  — the model of each subagent (on by default)
 *   turn.step    — the reasoning effort of the main loop (on by default)
 *   turn.step    — the model of the main loop (off by default: switching
 *                  models mid-session invalidates the prompt cache, which can
 *                  cost more than the cheaper tier saves)
 *
 * Every one of them moves in both directions: a task the decision model reads
 * as mechanical is routed down, one it reads as hard is routed up. The two
 * mistakes do not cost the same, so they do not clear the same confidence bar
 * (see `minUpgradeConfidence` / `minDowngradeConfidence` in policy.ts).
 *
 * The Agent tool has no effort parameter, so a subagent's effort is not ours
 * to set; only its model is.
 *
 * The prompt is classified at `prompt.submit`, which runs before the turn
 * starts, and the decision is applied at the turn's first request.
 *
 * Every failure path is fail-open: a classification that errors or runs past
 * the latency budget leaves the request exactly as the engine built it.
 *
 * The API key comes from the plugin's options (userConfig "typesafeApiKey"
 * or "gatewayApiKey"). Never hardcode it in this file.
 *
 * Needs CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 (Claude Code >= 2.1.259). Typed
 * against Anthropic's declarations: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/mods
 *
 * Privacy: with a key set, the prompt text is sent to whichever backend the
 * key belongs to.
