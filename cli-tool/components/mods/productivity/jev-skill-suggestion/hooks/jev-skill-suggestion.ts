/**
 * jev-skill-suggestion — Claude Mod (EARLY ACCESS)
 *
 * Takes the skill listing out of the context window and has TypeSafe's Jev,
 * a System One decision model, suggest at most one skill per prompt, going
 * by the skills' descriptions. The skills stay installed and loadable; what
 * goes away is the listing the engine sends the model every session, one
 * line per skill, whether the prompt has anything to do with any of them.
 *
 * The decision follows TypeSafe's "Skill suggestion" cookbook: two requests
 * per prompt, one to rank every skill and ask whether the prompt needs a
 * skill at all, one to re-read the top few with their full text and let each
 * be rejected on its own. Either may come back empty-handed.
 *
 * Three hooks:
 *   prompt.attachment  — the engine's `skill_listing` attachment is answered
 *                        with `{ text: null }` (left out) or trimmed to the
 *                        names in `alwaysListed`. Its names are remembered:
 *                        they are the engine's word on which skills the model
 *                        may invoke.
 *   prompt.submit      — the two requests run, and the winner (if any) is
 *                        attached to the prompt as a `<skill_relevance>`
 *                        block the model can act on with the Skill tool.
 *   skill.prompt       — observation only: whether the model took the
 *                        suggestion, or loaded a skill on its own.
 *
 * Jev is reached one of two ways, whichever key is configured: TypeSafe's
 * own API (`typesafeApiKey`), which reports a calibrated confidence, or the
 * Vercel AI Gateway (`gatewayApiKey`), which does not. With neither, the
 * engine's own `$.model.classify` stands in with a single request and no
 * gate, so the mod is useful without any account.
 *
 * The candidates come from `$.command.list()`, not from the listing: the
 * listing is only rendered at the turn's first request, after `prompt.submit`
 * has run, so the first prompt of a session would otherwise have nothing to
 * choose from. The listing, once seen, narrows the candidates to what the
 * engine itself would have shown.
 *
 * The second request reads the opening of each shortlisted skill's SKILL.md,
 * found on disk by how Claude Code lays skills out (project and user
 * `.claude/skills` and `.claude/commands`, a plugin's install path from
 * `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`). A body that cannot be found
 * leaves that skill with its one-line description; nothing fails over it.
 *
 * Only the main conversation is handled. A subagent's own listing is left as
 * the engine renders it: its prompt is a tool call's argument, not a
 * `prompt.submit`, so nothing here could suggest for it.
 *
 * Every failure path is fail-open: a request that errors or runs past the
 * latency budget lets the prompt through with no suggestion, and the listing
 * hook always answers the same way, so the model's prompt cache holds.
 *
 * The API key comes from the plugin's options (userConfig "typesafeApiKey"
 * or "gatewayApiKey"). Never hardcode it in this file.
 *
 * Needs CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 and Claude Code >= 2.1.278: the
 * `prompt.attachment` event is that release's. Typed against Anthropic's
 * declarations: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/mods
 *
 * Privacy: with a key set, the prompt text, every candidate skill's name and
 * description, and the opening of each shortlisted skill's SKILL.md are sent
 * to whichever backend the key belongs to.
