/**
 * jev-guardrails — pure decision logic.
 *
 * No `$` and no I/O here: this module builds the one request the decision
 * API takes per message, reads its answer, and turns that answer into one of
 * four actions. The hooks module does every call on `$` at its own call site.
 *
 * The shape follows TypeSafe's "Guardrails for LLMs" cookbook
 * (https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/guardrails): one request per message
 * carries a battery of yes/no questions, one per hazard, and one `score` for
 * how much harm complying would do. The input battery asks whether the user
 * is asking for it; the output battery asks whether the reply went ahead and
 * gave it. The application — this mod — owns the thresholds.
 *
 * Two backends speak to the same model with different wire shapes:
 *
 *   typesafe  POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone
 *             `{ model, state, questions }`; a yes/no question is a `noul`
 *             answered as `noul`, a rating is a `score` answered as `score`.
 *   gateway   POST https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model
 *             `{ state, questions }` with the model in a header; a yes/no
 *             question is a `boolean` answered as `probability`.
 *
 * The Gateway shape is not documented publicly; it was read from
 * @ai-sdk/gateway and @ai-sdk/provider.
