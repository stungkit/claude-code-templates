/**
 * jev-guardrails — Claude Mod (EARLY ACCESS)
 *
 * Screens every message going into and out of the main conversation with
 * TypeSafe's Jev, a System One decision model, the way TypeSafe's
 * "Guardrails for LLMs" cookbook does: one request per message carries a
 * battery of yes/no questions (is this a jailbreak? harm or a crime? a
 * diagnosis or a dosage? self-harm?) and one score for how much harm
 * complying would do. The probabilities come back; the thresholds that turn
 * them into pass / review / block / support live here, in a named policy.
 *
 * Two hooks:
 *   prompt.submit  — the input battery on the user's prompt.
 *                    pass     the prompt enters as typed.
 *                    review   the person is asked (`$.ui.ask`): send it, or
 *                             cancel; a dismissed dialog cancels too. With
 *                             no one to ask (a `-p` run, told by an empty
 *                             `$.session.surfaces()`) the prompt enters
 *                             with a <guardrail> note for the model instead.
 *                    block    `{ drop }` without `next`: the prompt never
 *                             enters, and the reason is shown.
 *                    support  the prompt enters with a note that tells the
 *                             model to respond to the person first; a
 *                             refusal here is the wrong answer.
 *   turn.step      — the output battery on each response's visible text.
 *                    `screenOutput: "block"` (default) holds the text from
 *                    its first chunk until the response's `stop`, screens
 *                    it, and either releases it or replaces it with a
 *                    withheld notice. `"audit"` streams everything live and
 *                    only logs. Tool-only responses are never held.
 *
 * Jev is reached one of two ways, whichever key is configured: TypeSafe's
 * own API (`typesafeApiKey`), which reports a calibrated probability per
 * answer, or the Vercel AI Gateway (`gatewayApiKey`). With neither, the
 * engine's own `$.model.classify` stands in, answering one of the four
 * actions with no probability, so the mod is useful without any account.
 *
 * Only the main conversation is screened unless `screenSubagents` is on: a
 * subagent's prompt is a tool call's argument, not a `prompt.submit`, so
 * only its output can be.
 *
 * Every failure path is fail-open by default: a request that errors or runs
 * past the latency budget lets the message through untouched, and says so.
 * `failClosed` turns that around for the input side: a prompt that could not
 * be screened is dropped. Output is never fail-closed.
 *
 * The API key comes from the plugin's options (userConfig "typesafeApiKey"
 * or "gatewayApiKey"). Never hardcode it in this file.
 *
 * Needs CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 (Claude Code >= 2.1.259). Typed
 * against Anthropic's declarations: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/mods
 *
 * Privacy: with a key set, the prompt text and the model's replies are sent
 * to whichever backend the key belongs to.
