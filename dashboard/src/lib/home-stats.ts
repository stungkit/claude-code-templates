/**
 * Seed data for the home hero counters.
 *
 * Each counter is a pure function of UTC wall-clock time:
 *
 *     value(t) = base + floor((t - baseAt) / msPerUnit)
 *
 * so every visitor, on every device and in every session, sees the same
 * number for the same instant, it never goes backwards across reloads, and
 * no storage or API call is involved.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How the seeds below were measured (2026-09-18) — refresh them the same way:
 *
 *   componentPrs merged PRs touching cli-tool/components/, counted over the
 *                full git history (270 since 2025-08-01).
 *                Rate: 56 merged in the previous 30 days.
 *
 *   npmInstalls  https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/<18mo range>/claude-code-templates
 *                -> 239282 total as of 2026-09-18.
 *                Rate: last-month point = 13995 downloads / 30 days.
 *
 *   downloads    component installs tracked in Supabase, as published by
 *                scripts/generate_trending_data.py in trending-data.json:
 *                globalStats.totalDownloads = 1340064 (all time, at its
 *                lastUpdated of 2026-07-05). That is the same figure the
 *                /trending page shows, so the two stay in agreement.
 *                Rate: globalStats.monthlyDownloads (227654) minus the
 *                132189-download spike that landed on 2026-07-05 itself,
 *                over the remaining 29 days -> ~3292/day, rounded to 3300.
 *                Do NOT take the rate from the per-component `downloads`
 *                field in components.json: that generator's Supabase
 *                pagination returns a partial set, so its totals move both
 *                up and down between runs.
